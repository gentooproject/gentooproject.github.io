	</ul>
	<p>All digital tools, whether they are hardware or software, should
	be secure. That is, they should protect you from surveillance, and
	stop your device from being controlled by others. Sadly, this is
	currently not the case. For many digital activities, you may end up
	needing dedicated programs or equipment intended to provide specific
	security features. Examples we use in this guide include software
	that allows you to <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encrypt">encrypt</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encrypt">

</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/pgp"></a>.</p>
	<p>But given the large number of companies and websites offering
	secure programs or hardware, how do you choose the one that's right
	for you?</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="1"></a><a name="Security"></a>Security
	is a Process, not a Purchase 
	</h2>
	<p>The first thing to remember before changing the software you use
	or buying new tools is that no tool is going to give you absolute
	protection from surveillance in all circumstances. Using <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encryption">encryption</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encryption">

	software will generally make it harder for others to read your
	communications or go through your computer's files. But attacks on
	your digital security will always seek out the weakest element of
	your security practices. When you use a new secure tool, you should
	think about how using it might affect other ways someone could
	target you. For example, if you decide to use a secure texting
	program to talk to a contact because you know that your phone might
	be compromised, might the fact that you're using this program at all
	give an <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/adversary">adversary</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/adversary">

  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/adversary"></a>
	a clue that you are talking about private information?</p>
	<p>Secondly, remember your <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/threat-model">threat
	model</a>. You don't need to buy some expensive encrypted phone
	system that claims to be &ldquo;NSA-proof&rdquo; if your biggest

	is physical surveillance from a private investigator with no access
	to internet surveillance tools. Alternatively, if you are facing a
	government that regularly jails dissidents <em>because</em> they use
	encryption tools, it may make sense to use simpler tricks&mdash;like
	a set of pre-arranged codes&mdash;rather than risk leaving evidence
	that you use encryption software on your laptop.</p>
	<p>Given all that, here are some questions you can ask about a tool
	before downloading, purchasing, or using it.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="2"></a><a name="Transparent"></a>How
	Transparent is it? 
	</h2>
	<p>Even though digital security seems to be mostly about keeping
	secrets, there's a strong belief among security researchers that
	openness and transparency leads to more secure tools.</p>
	<p>Much of the software used and recommended by the digital security
	community is open source, which is to say that the code that defines
	how it works is publicly available for others to examine, modify,
	and share. By being transparent about how their program works, the
	creators of these tools invite others to look for security flaws,
	and help improve the program.</p>
	<p>Open software provides the opportunity for better security but
	does not guarantee it. The open source advantage relies in part on a
	community of technologists actually checking the code, which for
	small projects (and even for popular, complex ones) may be hard to
	achieve. When you're considering using a tool, see if its source
	code is available, and whether the code has an independent security
	audit to confirm the quality of its security. At the very least,
	software or hardware should have a detailed technical explanation of
	how it functions, for other experts to inspect.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="3"></a><a name="Clarity"></a>How Clear
	are its Creators About its Advantages and Disadvantages? 
	</h2>
	<p>No software or hardware is entirely secure. Creators or sellers
	who are honest about the limitations of their product will give you
	a much stronger idea of whether their application is appropriate for
	you.</p>
	<p>Don't trust blanket statements that say that the code is
	&ldquo;military-grade&rdquo; or &ldquo;NSA-proof&rdquo;; these mean
	nothing and give a strong warning that the creators are
	overconfident or unwilling to consider the possible failings in
	their product.</p>
	<p>Because attackers are always trying to discover new ways to break
	the security of tools, software and hardware often needs to be
	updated to fix new vulnerabilities. It can be a serious problem if
	the creators of a tool are unwilling to do this, either because they
	fear bad publicity, or because they have not built the
	infrastructure to fix problems.</p>
	<p>You can't predict the future, but a good indicator of how
	toolmakers will behave in the future is their past activity. If the
	tool's website lists previous issues and links to regular updates
	and information&mdash;like specifically how long it has been since
	the software was last updated&mdash;you can be more confident that
	they will continue to provide this service in the future.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="4"></a><a name="Compromised"></a>What
	Happens if the Creators are Compromised? 
	</h2>
	<p>When security toolmakers build software and hardware, they (just
	like you) must have a clear <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/threat-model">threat
	model</a>. The best creators will explicitly describe what kind of
	attackers they can protect you from in their documentation.</p>
	<p>But there's one attacker that many manufacturers do not want to
	think about: what if they, themselves, are compromised or decide to
	<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/attack">attack</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/attack">
  <font color="#000080">

  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/attack"></a>
	their own users. For instance, a court or government may compel a
	company to give up personal data or create a &ldquo;backdoor&rdquo;
	that will remove all the protections their tool offers. You may want
	to consider the jurisdiction(s) where the creators are based. If
	your <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/threat">threat</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/threat">
  <font color="#000080">

  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/threat"></a>
	is from the government of Iran, for example, a US-based company will
	be able to resist Iranian court orders, even if it must comply with
	US orders.</p>
	<p>Even if a creator is able to resist government pressure, an
	attacker may attempt to achieve the same result by breaking into the
	toolmakers' own systems in order to attack its customers.</p>
	<p>The most resilient tools are those that consider this as a
	possible attack, and are designed to defend against this. Look for
	language that asserts that a creator cannot access private data,
	rather than promises that a creator <em>will</em> not. Look for
	institutions with a <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2014" target="_blank">reputation
	for fighting court orders for personal data</a>.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="5"></a><a name="Recalls"></a>Check for
	Recalls and Online Criticism 
	</h2>
	<p>Of course, companies selling products and enthusiasts advertising
	their latest software can be misled, be misleading, or even outright
	lie. A product that was originally secure might be discovered to
	have terrible flaws in the future. Make sure you stay well-informed
	on the latest news about the tools that you use.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="6"></a><a name="Sametool"></a>Do you
	Know Others who Use the Same Tool? 
	</h2>
	<p>It's a lot of work for one person to keep up with the latest news
	about a tool. If you have colleagues who use a particular product or
	service, work with them to stay informed about what's happening.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="7"></a><a name="Products"></a>Products
	Mentioned in This Guide 
	</h2>
	<p>We try to ensure that the software and hardware we mention in
	this guide complies with the criteria we've listed above: we have
	made a good faith effort to only list products that have a solid
	grounding in what we currently know about digital security, are
	generally transparent about their operation (and their failings),
	have defenses against the possibility that the creators themselves
	will be compromised, and are currently maintained, with a large and
	technically-knowledgeable user base. We believe that they have, at
	the time of writing, the eye of a wide audience who is examining
	them for flaws, and would raise concerns to the public quickly.
	Please understand that we do not have the resources to examine or
	make independent assurances about their security, we are not
	endorsing these products and cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="8"></a><a name="Which_device"></a>Which
	Phone Should I Buy? Which Computer? 
	</h2>
	<p>One of the most frequent questions asked of security trainers is
	&ldquo;Should I buy Android or an iPhone?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Should I
	use a PC or a Mac?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/operating-system">operating
	system</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/operating-system">
  <font color="#000080">
    <img src="Untitled%201_html_88aa64f4b52b6b2.png" name="Image8" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" border="1"/>
  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/operating-system"></a>
	should I use?&rdquo; There are no simple answers to these questions.
	The relative safety of software and devices is constantly shifting
	as new flaws are discovered and old bugs are fixed. Companies may
	compete with each other to provide you with better security, or they
	may all be under pressure from governments to weaken that security.</p>
	<p>Some general advice is almost always true, however. When you buy
	a device or an operating system, keep current with its software
	updates. Updates will often fix security problems in older code that
	attacks can exploit. Older phones and operating systems are no
	longer supported, even for security updates. In particular,
	Microsoft has made it clear that Windows XP and earlier Windows
	versions will not receive fixes for even severe security problems.
	If you use XP, you cannot expect it to be secure from attackers.
	(The same is true for OS X before 10.7.5 or &quot;Lion&quot;).</p>

<h2 class="western">Protecting Yourself on Social Networks</h2>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<p>Social networking sites are some of the most popular websites and
	tools we use on the Internet. Facebook, Google+, and Twitter have
	hundreds of millions of users each.</p>
	<p>Social networks are often built on the idea of sharing posts,
	photographs, and personal information. Yet they have also become
	forums for organizing and speech&mdash;much of which relies on
	privacy and pseudonymity. Thus, the following questions are
	important to consider when using social networks: How can I interact
	with these sites while protecting myself? My basic privacy? My
	identity? My contacts and associations? What information do I want
	keep private and who do I want to keep it private from?</p>
	<p>Depending on your circumstances, you may need to protect yourself
	against the social media site itself, against other users of the
	site, or both.</p>
	<p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when you&rsquo;re setting up
	your account:</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="11"></a>Registering for a Social Media

	Privacy Policy 
	</h2>
	<p>Remember that information stored by third parties is subject to
	their own policies and may be used for commercial purposes or shared
	with other companies, for example, marketing firms. We know that
	reading privacy policies is a near-impossible task, but you may want
	to take a look at sections on how your data is used, when it is
	shared with other parties, and how the service responds to law
	enforcement requests.</p>
	<p>Social networking sites, usually for-profit businesses, often
	collect sensitive information beyond what you explicitly input&mdash;where
	you are, what interests and advertisements you react to, what other
	sites you've visited (e.g. through &quot;Like&quot; buttons). It can
	be helpful to block third-party <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/cookies">cookies</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/cookies">

	and use tracker-blocking browser extensions to make sure extraneous
	information isn't being passively transmitted to third parties.</p>
	<p>Some social networking sites, like Facebook and Twitter, have

	<h2 class="western"><a name="31"></a>Change Your Privacy Settings

	<p>Specifically, change the default settings. For example, do you

	address or phone number? Do you want your location shared
	automatically?</p>

		</p>
	</ol>
	<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at each of these questions.</p>
	<h3 class="western">What do I want to protect?</h3>
	<p>An &ldquo;<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/asset">asset</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/asset">
  <font color="#000080">

  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/asset"></a>&rdquo;
	is something you value and want to protect. In the context of
	digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For
	example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and
	files are all possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.</p>
	<p><em>Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it&rsquo;s
	kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.</em></p>
	<h3 class="western">Who do I want to protect it from?</h3>
	<p>To answer this question, it&rsquo;s important to identify who
	might want to target you or your information. A person or entity
	that poses a threat to your assets is an &ldquo;<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/adversary">adversary</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/adversary">
  <font color="#000080">
    <img src="Untitled%201_html_45f2bf4fbd36e608.png" name="Image19" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" border="1"/>
  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/adversary"></a>.&rdquo;
	Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your former
	partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on
	a public network.</p>
	<p><em>Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to
	get ahold of your assets. Your list may include individuals, a
	government agency, or corporations.</em></p>
	<p>Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances
	this list might be something you want to destroy after you&rsquo;re
	done threat modeling.</p>
	<h3 class="western">How bad are the consequences if I fail?</h3>
	<p>There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For
	example, an adversary can read your private communications as they
	pass through the network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.</p>
	<p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A
	government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police
	violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability
	of that video. In contrast, a political opponent may wish to gain
	access to secret content and publish that content without you
	knowing.</p>
	<p>Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences
	could be if an adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To
	determine this, you should consider the <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/capability">capability</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/capability">
  <font color="#000080">
    <img src="Untitled%201_html_45f2bf4fbd36e608.png" name="Image20" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" border="1"/>
  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/capability"></a>
	of your adversary. For example, your mobile phone provider has
	access to all your phone records and thus has the capability to use
	that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access
	your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger
	capabilities.</p>
	<p><em>Write down what your adversary might want to do with your
	private data.</em></p>
	<h3 class="western">How likely is it that I will need to protect it?</h3>
	<p>Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a
	particular asset will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with
	capability. While your mobile phone provider has the capability to
	access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data
	online to harm your reputation is low.</p>
	<p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a
	threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that
	the threat will occur. For instance, there is a threat that your
	building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far
	greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in
	Stockholm (where they are not).</p>
	<p>Conducting a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/risk-analysis">risk
	analysis</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/risk-analysis">

  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/risk-analysis"></a>
	is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the
	same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people find
	certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the
	mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost.
	In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view
	the threat as a problem.</p>
	<p><em>Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and
	which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat)
	to worry about.</em></p>
	<h3 class="western">How much trouble am I willing to go through to
	try to prevent potential consequences?</h3>
	<p>Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis.
	Not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same
	way.</p>
	<p>For example, an attorney representing a client in a national
	security case would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to
	protect communications about that case, such as using encrypted
	email, than a mother who regularly emails her daughter funny cat
	videos.</p>
	<p><em>Write down what options you have available to you to help
	mitigate your unique threats. Note if you have any financial
	constraints, technical constraints, or social constraints.</em></p>

	can change as your situation changes. Thus, conducting frequent

	<p>Create your own threat model based on your own unique situation.
	Then mark your calendar for a date in the future. This will prompt
	you to review your threat model and check back in to assess whether
	it&rsquo;s still relevant to your situation.</p>

	<p>When two people want to communicate securely (for example, Akiko
	and Boris) they must each generate crypto keys. Before Akiko sends a
	message to Boris she encrypts it to Boris's <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key">key</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key">

<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/decrypt"></a>
	it. Then she sends the already-encrypted message across the
	Internet. If anyone is eavesdropping on Akiko and Boris&mdash;even
	if they have access to the service that Akiko is using to send this
	message (such as her email account)&mdash;they will only see the
	encrypted data and will be unable read the message. When Boris
	receives it, he must use his key to decrypt it into a readable
	message.</p>
	<p>End-to-end encryption involves some effort, but it's the only way
	that users can verify the security of their communications without
	having to trust the platform that they're both using. Some services,
	such as Skype, have <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10983/what-are-p2p-communications" target="_blank">claimed</a>
	to offer end-to-end encryption when it appears that they actually
	don't. For end-to-end encryption to be secure, users must be able to
	verify that the crypto key they're encrypting messages to belongs to
	the people they believe they do. If communications software doesn't
	have this ability built-in, then any <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encryption">encryption</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encryption">

	You can tell that your email provider supports HTTPS if you log in
	to your webmail and the URL at the top of your browser begins with
	the letters HTTPS instead of HTTP (for example:
	<a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com</a>).</p>
	<p>If your email provider supports HTTPS, but does not do so by
	default, try replacing HTTP with HTTPS in the URL and refresh the
	page. If you&rsquo;d like to make sure that you are always using
	HTTPS on sites where it is available, download the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS

	<p>Some webmail providers that use HTTPS by default include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Gmail

		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Riseup 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p>Yahoo 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>Some webmail providers that give you the option of choosing to
	use HTTPS by default by selecting it in your settings. The most
	popular service that still does this is Hotmail.</p>
	<p>What does transport-layer encryption do and why might you need
	it? HTTPS, also referred to as SSL or TLS, encrypts your
	communications so that it cannot be read by other people on your
	network. This can include the other people using the same Wi-Fi in
	an airport or at a caf&eacute;, the other people at your office or
	school, the administrators at your ISP, malicious hackers,
	governments, or law enforcement officials. Communications sent over
	your web browser, including the web pages that you visit and the
	content of your emails, blog posts, and messages, using HTTP rather
	than HTTPS are trivial for an attacker to intercept and read.</p>
	<p>HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing
	that we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your
	seat belt when you drive.</p>
	<p>But there are some things that HTTPS does not do. When you send
	email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted
	copy of your communication. Governments and law enforcement may be
	able to access this data with a warrant. In the United States, most
	email providers have a policy that says they will tell you when you
	have received a government request for your user data as long as
	they are legally allowed to do so, but these policies are strictly
	voluntary, and in many cases providers are legally prevented from
	informing their users of requests for data. Some email providers,
	such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, publish transparency reports,
	detailing the number of government requests for user data they
	receive, which countries make the requests, and how often the
	company has complied by turning over data.</p>

	<p>Metadata can provide extremely revealing information about you
	even when the content of your communication remains secret.</p>
	<p>Metadata about your phone calls can give away some very intimate
	and sensitive information. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">They know you rang a phone sex

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">They know you spoke with an HIV

		<li/>
<p>They know you called a gynecologist, spoke for a half
		hour, and then called the local Planned Parenthood's number later

		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>If you are calling from a cell phone, <em>information about your
	location is metadata</em>. In 2009, Green Party politician Malte
	Spitz sued Deutsche Telekom to force them to hand over six months of
	Spitz&rsquo;s phone data, which he made available to a German

	Managers

	<p>Reusing passwords is an exceptionally bad security practice. If a
	bad actor gets ahold of a password that you've reused across
	multiple services, they can gain access to many of your accounts.
	This is why having multiple, strong, unique passwords is so

<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/password-manager"></a>
	can help. A password manager is a tool that creates and stores
	passwords for you, so you can use many different passwords on
	different sites and services without having to memorize them.
	Password managers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">generate strong passwords that
		a human being would be unlikely to guess. 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p>store several passwords (and responses to security

	<p>KeePassXC is an example of a password manager that is open-source

  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/web-browser"></a>.
	KeePassXC does not automatically save changes you make when using
	it, so if it crashes after you've added some passwords, you can lose
	them forever. You can change this in the settings.</p>

	<p>Remember:</p>

<p>using a password manager creates a single point of

		<li/>
<p>password managers are an obvious target for adversaries.</p>
		<li/>
<p>research suggests that many password managers have
		vulnerabilities.</p>
	</ul>
	<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about expensive digital attacks, consider
	something more low-tech. You can create strong passwords manually
	(see &ldquo;Creating strong passwords using dice&rdquo; below),
	write them down, and keep them somewhere safe on your person.</p>
	<p><em>Wait, aren&rsquo;t we supposed to keep passwords in our heads
	and never write them down?</em> Actually, writing them down, and
	keeping them somewhere like your wallet, is useful so you&rsquo;ll
	at least know if your written passwords go missing or get stolen.</p>

	<p>One of many difficulties when people choose passwords themselves
	is that <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/%7Enick/aaronson-oracle/">people
	aren't very good at making random, unpredictable choices</a>. An
	effective way of creating a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases">strong
	and memorable password</a> is to use <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">dice</a>
	and a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">word
	list</a> to randomly choose words. Together, these words form your
	&ldquo;passphrase.&rdquo; A &quot;passphrase&quot; is a type of
	password that is longer for added security. For disk encryption and
	your password manager, we recommend selecting a minimum of six
	words.</p>
	<p><em>Why use a minimum of six words? Why use dice to pick words in
	a phrase randomly?</em> The longer and more random the password, the
	harder it is for both computers and humans to guess. To find out why
	you need such a long, hard-to-guess password, here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-how-make-super-secure-password-using-dice">video

	and a second factor) to gain access to their account. The second
	factor could be a one-off secret code or a number generated by a
	program running on a mobile device.</p>
	<p>Two-factor authentication using a mobile phone can be done in one
	of two ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">your phone can run an
		authenticator application that generates security codes (such as
		<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Google
		Authenticator</a> or <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>) or you
		can use a stand-alone hardware device (such as a YubiKey); or 
		</p>
		<li/>
<p>the service can send you an SMS text message with an extra
		security code that you need to type in whenever you log in. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have a choice, pick the authenticator application or
	stand-alone hardware device instead of receiving codes by text
	message. It&rsquo;s easier for an attacker to redirect these codes
	to their own phone than it is to bypass the authenticator.</p>
	<p>Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list
	of one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. These are
	meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you.
	Each of these passwords works only once, so if one is stolen by
	spyware when you enter it, the thief won't be able to use it for
	anything in the future.</p>
	<p>If you or your organization run your own communications
	infrastructure, there's free software available that can be used to
	enable two-factor authentication for accessing your systems. Look
	for software offering implementations of the open standard
	&ldquo;Time-Based One-Time Passwords&rdquo; or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">RFC

<h2 class="western">Keeping Your Data Safe</h2>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<p>One of the greatest challenges of defending your data from those
	who might want it is the sheer size of the information you store or
	carry, and the ease by which it can be taken from you. Many of us
	carry entire histories of our contacts, our communications, and our
	current documents on laptops, or even mobile phones. That data can
	include confidential information of dozens, even thousands, of
	people. A phone or laptop can be stolen, or copied in seconds.</p>
	<p>The United States is just one of many countries that seizes and
	copies data at borders. Data can be taken from you at roadblocks,
	grabbed from you in the street, or burgled from your house.</p>

	you can also make it harder for those who physically steal data to
	unlock its secrets. Computers and mobile phones can be locked by
	passwords, PINs or gestures, but these locks do not help protect
	data if the device itself is seized. It's relatively simple to
	bypass these locks, because your data is stored in an easily
	readable form within the device. All an attacker needs to do is to
	access the storage directly, and the data can be copied or examined
	without knowing your <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/password">password</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/password">

	all of your data, not just a few folders. Most computers and

	Android offers it under its &quot;Security&quot; settings, Apple
	devices such as the iPhone and iPad describe it as &quot;Data

	running Windows Pro, it's known as &quot;BitLocker.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
	<p>BitLocker's code is closed and proprietary, which means it is
	hard for external reviewers to know exactly how secure it is. Using
	BitLocker requires you trust Microsoft provides a secure storage
	system without hidden vulnerabilities. On the other hand, if you're
	already using Windows, you are already trusting Microsoft to the
	same extent. If you are worried about surveillance from the kind of
	attackers who might know of or benefit from a back door in either

	feature on macOS called FileVault.&nbsp; On Linux distributions,
	full-disk encryption is usually offered when you first set up your
	system. At the time this guide was updated, we do not have a full
	disk encryption tool for versions of Windows that do not include
	BitLocker that we can recommend.</p>
	<p>Whatever your device calls it, encryption is only as good as your
	password. If your attacker has your device, they have all the time
	in the world to try out new passwords. Forensic software can try
	millions of passwords a second. That means that a four number pin is
	unlikely to protect your data for very long at all, and even a long
	password may merely slow down your attacker. A really strong
	password under these conditions should be over fifteen characters
	long.</p>
	<p>Most of us are not realistically going to learn and enter such
	passphrases on our phones or mobile devices. So while encryption can
	be useful to prevent casual access, you should preserve truly
	confidential data by keeping it hidden from physical access by
	attackers, or cordoned away on a much more secure machine.</p>
	<h2 class="western"><a name="15"></a>Create a Secure Machine 
	</h2>
	<p>Maintaining a secure environment can be hard work. At best, you
	have to change passwords, habits, and perhaps the software you use
	on your main computer or device. At worst, you have to constantly
	think about whether you're leaking confidential information or using
	unsafe practices. Even when you know the problems, some solutions
	may be out of your hands. Other people might require you to continue
	unsafe digital security practices even after you have explained the
	dangers. For instance, work colleagues might want you to continue to
	open email attachments from them, even though you know your
	attackers could impersonate them and send you <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/malware">malware</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/malware">

</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/malware"></a>.
	Or you may be concerned that your main computer has already been
	compromised.</p>
	<p>One strategy to consider is cordoning off valuable data and
	communications onto a more secure computer. Use that machine only
	occasionally, and when you do, consciously take much more care over
	your actions. If you need to open attachments, or use insecure
	software, do it on another machine.</p>
	<p>If you're setting up a secure machine, what extra steps can you
	take to make it secure?</p>
	<p>You can almost certainly keep the device in a more physically
	safe place: somewhere where you are able to tell if it has been
	tampered with, such as a locked cabinet.</p>
	<p>You can install a privacy- and security-focused <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/operating-system">operating

<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/operating-system"></a>
	like Tails. You might not be able (or want) to use an open source
	operating system in your everyday work, but if you just need to
	store, edit and write confidential emails or instant messages from
	this secure device, Tails will work well, and defaults to high
	security settings.</p>
	<p>An extra, secure computer may not be as expensive an option as
	you think. A computer that is seldom used, and only runs a few
	programs, does not need to be particularly fast or new. You can buy
	an older netbook for a fraction of the price of a modern laptop or
	phone. Older machines also have the advantage that secure software
	like Tails may be more likely to work with them than newer models.</p>
	<p>You can use the secure machine to keep the primary copy of
	confidential data. A secure machine can be valuable in cordoning off
	private data in this way, but you should also consider a couple of
	extra risks it might create. If you concentrate your most treasured
	information onto this one computer, it may make it more of an
	obvious target. Keep it well hidden, don't discuss its location, and
	don't neglect to <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encrypt">encrypt</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encrypt">

<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/password"></a>,
	so that if it is stolen, the data will remain unreadable without the

	<p>Another risk is the danger that destroying this one machine will
	destroy your only copy of the data.</p>

	would benefit from you losing all your data, don't keep it in just
	one place, no matter how secure. Encrypt a copy and keep it
	somewhere else.</p>
	<p>The highest level of protection from Internet attacks or online
	surveillance is, not surprisingly, not connecting to the Internet at
	all. You could make sure your secure computer never connects to a
	local network or Wifi, and only copy files onto the machine using
	physical media, like DVDs or USB drives. In network security, this
	is known as having an &quot;<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/air-gap">air

	complete computer unplugged from the Internet.</p>
	<p>If you do use the secure device to connect to the Internet, you
	might choose not to log in or use your usual accounts. Create

	hidden from those services. If someone is choosing to specifically
	target your identity with malware, or is only intercepting your

	between your identity, and this particular machine.</p>
	<p>A variation on the idea of a secure machine is to have an
	<em>insecure machine: </em>a device that you only use when you are
	going into dangerous places or need to try a risky operation. Many
	journalists and activists, for instance, take a minimal netbook with
	them when they travel. This computer does not have any of their
	documents, usual contact or email information on it, and so is less
	of a loss if it is confiscated or scanned. You can apply the same
	strategy to mobile phones. If you usually use a smartphone, consider

	encryption for us. Digital encryption technology has expanded beyond
	simple secret messages; today, encryption can be used for more
	elaborate purposes, for example to verify the author of messages or
	to browse the Web anonymously with Tor.</p>
	<p>Under some circumstances, encryption can be fairly automatic and
	simple. But there are ways encryption can go wrong, and the more you
	understand it, the safer you will be against such situations.</p>

	<h3 class="western">Private and Public Keys</h3>
	<p>One of the most important concepts to understand in encryption is
	a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key">key</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key">
  <font color="#000080">

<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key"></a>.
	Common types of encryption include a private key, which is kept
	secret on your computer and lets you read messages that are intended
	only for you. A private key also lets you place unforgeable digital
	signatures on messages you send to other people. A public key is a
	file that you can give to others or publish that allows people to
	communicate with you in secret, and check signatures from you.
	Private and public keys come in matched pairs, like the halves of a
	rock that has been split into two perfectly matching pieces, but
	they are not the same.</p>
	<h3 class="western">Security Certificates</h3>
	<p>Another extremely valuable concept to understand is a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/security-certificate-0">security
	certificate</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/security-certificate-0">
  <font color="#000080">

	The <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/web-browser">Web

<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/web-browser"></a>
	on your computer can make encrypted connections to sites using
	<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/https">HTTPS</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/https">
  <font color="#000080">
    <img src="Untitled%201_html_88aa64f4b52b6b2.png" name="Image97" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" border="1"/>

<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/https"></a>.
	When they do that, they examine certificates to check the public
	keys of domain names&mdash;(like <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>,
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a>,
	or <a href="http://ssd.eff.org/" target="_blank">ssd.eff.org</a>).
	Certificates are one way of trying to determine if you know the
	right public key for a person or website, so that you can
	communicate securely with them.</p>
	<p>From time to time, you will see certificate-related error
	messages on the Web. Most commonly, this is because a hotel or cafe
	network is trying to break your secret communications with the
	website. It is also common to see an error because of a bureaucratic
	mistake in the system of certificates. But occasionally, it is
	because a hacker, thief, police agency, or spy agency is breaking
	the encrypted connection.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to tell the difference
	between these cases. This means you should never click past a
	certificate warning if it relates to a site where you have an
	account, or are reading any sensitive information.</p>
	<h3 class="western">Key Fingerprints</h3>
	<p>The word &quot;<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/fingerprint">fingerprint</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/fingerprint">
  <font color="#000080">
    <img src="Untitled%201_html_88aa64f4b52b6b2.png" name="Image98" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" border="1"/>
  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/fingerprint"></a>&quot;
	means lots of different things in the field of computer security.
	One use of the term is a &quot;<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key-fingerprint">key
	fingerprint</a><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key-fingerprint">
  <font color="#000080">
    <img src="Untitled%201_html_88aa64f4b52b6b2.png" name="Image99" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" border="1"/>
  </font>
</a>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key-fingerprint"></a>,&quot;
	a string of characters like &quot;342e 2309 bd20 0912 ff10 6c63 2192
	1928&quot; that should allow you to uniquely and securely check that
	someone on the Internet is using the right private key. If you check
	that someone's key fingerprint is correct, that gives you a higher
	degree of certainty that it's really them. But it's not perfect,
	because if the keys are copied or stolen someone else would be able
	to use the same fingerprint.</p>
